---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: Describe your code for traversing a user-specified path.  How
>> do traversals of absolute and relative paths differ?

In filesysdir_create(), filesysdir_chdir(), filesys_create(), filesys_open() and filesys_close() we call the following function first
bool filesys_parse_path(const char *name,char *filename, block_sector_t *final_dir_sector)
where name:    - Input name
      filename - Output name which will used further in the above functions
      final_dir_sector - The sector to create/open/remove files.

The function is used to traverse relative or absolute path. At the start of the function final_dir_sector is equal to the the current thread working directory's sector indicated by struct thread's cwd_sector_number. The funtion's behaviour is best elaborated with examples before.  
Eg1: name: a/b/c (relative path)
     We seperate strings based on delimiter "/" and get the number of strings we get. Here they are "a","b","c"
     Iteration 1: Check if current directory(final_dir_sector is used in dir_open) has "a"and it is a directory. If so update final_dir_sector to "a"'s sector.  
     Iteration 2: Check if current directory(final_dir_sector is used in dir_open) has "b"and it is a directory. If so update final_dir_sector to "b"'s sector.  
     Iteration 3: "c" is the last string. So we copy filename to "c" and exit.
     After exiting the function, filename = "c" and final_sector_number = Dir of "b". So we can create/remove/open "c" in "b".  
Eg2: name: /a/b/c (absolute path)
     Before seperating things, if name[0] = "/", then we initilaize final_dir_sector to ROOT_DIR_SECTOR. Then same steps as before happens
Eg3: name: a (relative path)
     We seperate strings based on delimiter "/" and get the number of strings we get. Here they are "a"
     Iteration 1: "a" is the last string. So we copy filename to "a" and exit.
     After exiting the function, filename = "a" and final_sector_number = current directory of thread. So we can create/remove/open "a" in current directory.  
  

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B4: How do you prevent races on directory entries?  For example,
>> only one of two simultaneous attempts to remove a single file
>> should succeed, as should only one of two simultaneous attempts to
>> create a file with the same name, and so on.

The inode struct has a dir_lock associated with it as mentioned above.
This dir_lock is used for synchronization. Every one of these functions: dir_lookup (), dir_add (), dir_remove () locks and unlocks the dir->inode at the beginning and the end. This achieves directory synchronization
Eg1: If 2 processes try to remove a single file, the first process would lock the parent directory of the file and would release it only after removing the file. During this time, the 2nd process waits and when it actually does remove, it wont find the file and so it would exit.
Eg2: If 2 processes try to create the same file, the first process would lock the parent directory of the file and would release it only after creating the file. During this time, the 2nd process waits and when it actually does create, it would find the file existing already and so it would exit.

Out implementation does not allow a directory to be removed if it open or if
it is a process's current working directory. 
In dir_remove (), when we pick a directory entry to be removed, we know the inode of the entry. From the inode_disk->type (mentioned above), we would know if the entry to be removed is itlsef a directory or not.
-  If the entry is a directory and its inode open count is more than 1, we prevent its removal. 

The inode_disk associated with an inode also stores the number of valid entries it has. They are assigned to 0 when we create the directory. When we dir_add () to this directory, the number is incremented. When we dir_remove () to this directory, the number is decremented.
-  If the entry is a directory and its inode_disk->num_of_valid_entries is not 0, we prevent its removal. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B6: Explain why you chose to represent the current directory of a
>> process the way you did.

The thread struct has cwd_sector_number which represents current working directory of a process. Whenever we do "cd", we update the cwd_sector_number.  
This is easier to implement as we dont have to
protect it with any synchronization primitives. Also when a child process is created, it can easily initilaize its cwd_sector_number from its parent thread's cwd_sector_number in thread_create ().

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

We have a bitmap of free cache blocks. 

We maintain a cache_list which is a list of cache blocks in use. Everytime we miss in cache, we try to find a block,
we try to get a free cache block from cache_bitmap and add it to cache_list. Only when bitmap doesn't return a cache block, eviction kicks in.

We maintain a cache_hand pointer which points to an element in cache_block. On initialization, cache_hand is NULL.
Everytime we insert a cache_block from bitmap, we insert it next to current cache_hand and move the cache_hand to point to inserted element.
Eg: Trying to insert [B1] to [H]->[B0]->[T], cache_hand = [B0]
    After insertion:         [H]->[B0]->[B1]->[T], cache_hand = [B1]

When we release a cache_block(which happens only during system shutdown), we return the cache block to bitmap.
If cache_hand points to the block to remove, move cache_hand to previous element/block.
Eg:  If cache_hand == the element to remove
     [H]->[B0]->[B1]->[B2]->[T] , cache_hand = [B1] ---(point to next)---> cache_hand = [B0]
     [H]->[B0]->[B1]->[B2]->[T] , cache_hand = [B0] ---(wrap around)---> cache_hand = [B2]

cache_entry also has a type and boolean value called meta_retry. When we access a meta data, we will update the type and set this value. 

Coming to the actual cache block choosen during eviction, we start from element to next of cache_hand(From the insertion example above, we
would start from [B0] thus implementing LRU) and go through the list in forward direction similar to "clocking".
- If we find a block which was pinned, we go to the next block.
- If we find a block which was META type and has meta_retry SET, then we clear meta_retry and continue to next block. This gives a third chance to META data(in addition to accessed).
- If we find a block which was accessed, then we clear accessed and continue to next block. This gives a second chance to accessed.
- If none of the above cases are true, the block is chosen for eviction. 



>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

During start of the program, we start a "filesys_helper" thread which does a timer sleep for 100 ticks.
Timer sleep uses the alarm clock logic so we dont do busy waiting. After the timer tick, we implement write-back. We start from cache_hand(clock_hand) and find the first dirty block and we write it back. if we reach 64 blocks without finding a dirty block, we exit the function. 
 

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

Every time we do a inode read, we pass the next sector to read-ahead. During read, we create a cache_read_ahead_entry and add it to cache_read_ahead_list at the back. In the filesys_handler, after write_behind, we do read-ahead.
In read-ahead, we pop the front entry from cache_read_ahead_list. If that sector is not a hit in cache, we read the sector into cache. We implement eviction as before if no empty cache block is available. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

As indicated above, we dont pick a cache block for eviction if the block is pinned. We use pinning to prevent the 
above case. Whenever we have a cache read or write, we traverse the cache_block_list(we acquire cache_lock) and look for hit or miss. After we get a cache_block for read or write, we pin the cache_block before releasing cache_lock. And we unpin the block only after read or write is complete. This way after cache_lock is released, if any other request tries to evict the block, it would see that it is pinned thus preventing race condition. 

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

In cache_entry, we have 2 variables, sector and old_sector. Old_sector is always MAX_SECTORS. 
Eg: Read to sector 2 tries to replace sector 1 which is dirty.
When we pick a cache_block 1 for evicting(we have acquired cache_lock), we transfer sector to old_sector when the evicting block is dirty, so old_sector=1. We update the sector to 2 and release the lock. 
If we have a read or write to sector 1, 
 - we will acquire cache_lock.
 - we will try to get a hit by looking into sector of all cache blocks.
 - we will miss. Before we do eviction, we will try to see if we hit in old_sector.
 - we will hit in old_sector. We will release cache_lock and go back to 1st step and retry.
After we write back sector 1, we update old_sector to MAX_SECTORS. Thus the other looping access would stop looping and implement eviction to bring back sector 1.  

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.
 
Buffer caching: With a sector size of say 512 Bytes. If a workload reads/writes 8 Bytes of file at a time, we wouldnt do a filesystem read/write everytime but do read/write on cache block. We save almost 64 access to that sector. If it is awrite, Only when eviction happens we need to write back.

Read-ahead: In the same example above, if we read 8 bytes of a file at a time and if the file size is multiple sectors long, the first read to one sector would try to read-ahead next sector. By the time we read the next sector, there is great possibility that it would be in cache already. This saves the miss latency for this workload.

Write-behind: If a process has huge memory stamp and most of it is writing then we would have heavy eviction happening and there is a great possibility of picking a dirty block for eviction. If we implement write ahead, it would be easier to find a clean block for eviction thus saving the time to write back.
